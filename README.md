# Sentiment Classification

This repository provides a simple pipeline for classifying movie reviews as
positive or negative.  The project uses a TF‑IDF representation of the review
text and trains a logistic regression model on the provided training data.

## Project structure

```

├── data
│   ├── train.csv
│   └── test.csv
├── notebooks
│   └── eda.ipynb

```

- `data/train.csv` – labelled training set with columns `reviews_content`
  and `category`.
- `data/test.csv` – unlabelled reviews used for generating predictions.
- `outputs/submission.csv` – example predictions generated by `main.py`.
- `src/` – preprocessing utilities, model training code and prediction logic.
- `notebooks/eda.ipynb` – exploratory data analysis notebook.

## Setup

Install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The requirements include `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib` and
`wordcloud`.

## Running the pipeline

Execute the entire training and prediction pipeline with:

```bash
python main.py
```

This script will:

1. Load the training data from `data/train.csv`.
2. Clean and vectorise the review text using TF‑IDF features.
3. Train a logistic regression model.
4. Apply the model to the reviews in `data/test.csv` and write the
   predictions to `outputs/submission.csv`.

During training, the data is split into train and validation subsets and the
validation accuracy is printed to the console.

## Notes

The dataset shipped with this repository contains roughly fifty thousand
training examples and seventeen thousand test examples.  Only two sentiment
labels are used: `positive` and `negative`.
